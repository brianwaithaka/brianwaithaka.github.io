## Introduction <!-- omit from toc --> 
Hello. This is my git cheat sheet for me to easily refer to. 

Over time I will append links to official documentation. If something does not look right, [please reach out](mailto:brian@waithaka.me).

#### Git clone
Used when beginning work on a new project and you need a local copy of the repo. Keep in mind this preserves previous commits made by others. 

```git
git clone https://<username>/<repository>.git
```
For a fresh start, download the files as a zip and
```git
git init
```

#### Git push
If working on a new branch created locally, you must first set upstream

```git
git push â€“-set-upstream origin <new_or_old_branch>
```


#### Git pull
Performs a git fetch and git merge in a single operation. 
If there are merge conflicts, they must be resolved by passing various arguments. 

```git
git pull origin
```

```git
git pull origin --rebase 
``` 


#### Git branch
List all the local branches 
```git
git branch
```
To list remote branches, include the -a flag
```git
git branch -a
```

Change the branch name with the -m flag. **Note**. Checkout the branch you want to rename

```git
git branch -m <new_branch_name>
```

Update new branch name upstream
```git
git push <remote> :<old_branch_name> <new_branch_name>
```
And then set upstream through a git push

Delete a branch by adding -d flag and ensure you are not checked into said branch
```git
git branch -d <branch>
```

Use -D flag to force delete. Ensure you are okay with losing unmerged changes
```git
git branch -D <branch>
```

#### Git checkout
Switches to an existing branch 
```git
git checkout <branch name>
```

Creates a new branch and switches to it 
```git
git checkout -b <branch name>
```

#### Git remote
Check url set for push and pull to remote repository

```git
git remote -v
```

Change remote repository url
```git
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
```

Shows entire remote configuration including all references to branches
```git
git remote show origin
```



#### Git fetch
Prunes local references to branches that are no longer on the remote repository

```git
git fetch --prune or git fetch -p
```

#### Git config
Change global settings for git locally
```git
git config --global --edit
```
